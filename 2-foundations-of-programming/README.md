## Exercises

### Basic Requirements

#### Numbers

1. Enter the following expressions into your console.

   ```js
   1 + 2 /** 3 **/
   3 * 5 /** 15 **/
   5 / 4 - 13 /** -11.75 **/
   5000 * 234 /** 1170000 **/
   1073 / 57 + 200 /** 218.82456140350877 **/
   ```

2. Why are the values produced by the following two expressions different? What
   are they?

   ```js
   3 + 2 * 4 - 1 
   (3 + 2) * (4 - 1)
   /** because the parenthesis are priority in js console **/
   ```

3. Calculate 50 years in minutes using the console.
<!-- 26280000 -->
4. What is the percentage of letters in the english alphabet that are vowels (including y)? Use the
   console to find out.

5. Try the following expressions in the console:

   ```js
   6 % 2 /** 0 **/
   42 % 10 /** 2 **/
   5 % 2 /** 1 **/
   6 % 3 /** 0 **/
   7 % 4 /** 3 **/
   100 % 12 /** 4 **/
   ```

   What is the significance of the result? How does the `%` (modulus) operator
   work?

6. Try the following:

   ```js
   3 % 2 /** 1 **/
   4 % 2 /** 0 **/
   5 % 2 /** 1 **/
   6 % 2 /** 0 **/
   ```

   What do the results tell you about the first operand to the modulus operator?



#### Strings

1. Write a string that represents your full name.
<!-- console.log('Rihab Ameni') -->

2. Write a string that represents your favorite food.

3. Use the `+` operator to combine (known as *concatenation*) two or more
   strings, *e.g.*:

   ```js
   // Your first and last names
   "John" + " " + "Doe"
   ```

   + Your first and last names (as shown above)
   + Your best friend's full name
   + Your home town, state and country


4. Fix the errors in the following strings:

   ```js
   Where are all the quotes?
   'hmm something is not right'
   'Do other ' + 'operators work with string concatenation'
   ```
